# BeeBot-Watcher Version 2.0
Coding & Dev by [Airwavy!!](https://youtube.com/c/AirwavyIT)

This project is made for my discord server and developing my coding skill.

BeeBot can detect @everyone or @here then delete that message, alerting spammers and report our staffs.

BeeBot can detect question of users that asked and BeeBot is replying them question. (Only question in question.ts)

Also BeeBot can play the music with slash commands but it's still beta. (Using discord-player library)

Using Typescript, Discord.js Version 13

Open source.
